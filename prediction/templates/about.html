Diabetes is a very common problem and people from all age group suffer from this disease. According to the census it was found that 56 million people in the World, have been diagnosed diabetes.

            We therefore came up with a idea of creating a ML based Web App, which can be used by accessed by anyone and from any corner of the world. DiaWay as the name suggest helps to keep you away from Diabetes. Even though there's no diabetes cure, diabetes can be treated and controlled, and some people may go into remission. The Webapp contains a Machine Learning based prediction system which takes features like glucose, blood pressure and bmi which are very useful diabetic features and gives result that says whether you suffer from diabetes or not. We donot give result but also a report of the patient which can be of utmost importance as he can showcase the report file in future in case if needed. “Diabetes sounds like you’re going to die when you hear it. But once you get a better idea of what it is and you can definately manage it.” We have also given some basic tips that should be followed by everyone doesnot matter whether you suffer from it or not you can have a look at them, it will surely help you to have a healthy life in staying away from diabetes.
